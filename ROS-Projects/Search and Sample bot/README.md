## Search and Sample Bot
I am trying to implement few abilities of the MARS ROVERs, and trying to make a Search and Sample Rover. 

### Technology Stack
- Python3
- OpenCV 
- Roversim (for simulation of world)

### Status :
I worked on many algorithms for this project and was able to map the region of interest and can implement this Computer vision strategy to other projects requiring Mapping the world!

### Where can it be used?
It can be applied to use when you need a bird's eye view using the on ground footage by applying *Warp transform* and so on.
